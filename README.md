üéØ **Introduction:** Here is my solution to the Battleship Field Validator problem on Codewars.

---

## üìú Problem Description
The problem challenges us to create a method that evaluates a field for the renowned board game "Battleship". It should return `True` if the field has a valid disposition of ships, and `False` otherwise. The field is a 10x10 two-dimensional array, with:
- `0`: The cell is free.
- `1`: The cell is occupied by a ship.

### üö¢ Battleship Rules (Soviet/Russian version):

- üö§ There should be 4 submarines of 1 cell each.
- üõ•Ô∏è There should be 3 destroyers of 2 cells each.
- üõ≥Ô∏è There should be 2 cruisers of 3 cells each.
- üö¢ One battleship of 4 cells.
- Every ship (except submarines) must be in a straight line.
- Ships can't overlap or touch either by side or corner.

## üõ† Solution
The `validate_battlefield` function in Python verifies if the ships on the given field are arranged validly. It checks ship orientations, lengths, and coordinates, and counts each ship type to ensure the rules are met.

## üöÄ Usage
Invoke the `validate_battlefield` function by passing a 10x10 field represented as a 2-dimensional list. Each list item should be either `0` (empty) or `1` (ship). The function then determines if the ship arrangement is valid.

### Example usage:
    field =  [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

    result = validate_battlefield(field)
    print(result)  # Output: True
